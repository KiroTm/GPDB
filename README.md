# #Introduction (with FAQs)
## What is this?
A random repository that'll guide you through some basic utility codes that every Discord.js bot uses or most of them.

## Why refer your repository when i have million other videos and sources to get such codes from?🤔
I don't think anyone can answer this question, but to my understanding, i think it'll be good for both us to stick together on this project and help each other out!
You can help me by debugging my code files and informing me asap. 

## What if i can't find the code not working and need help?🤔
If you find yourself in such a situation, i would recommend you to go through the following steps:
1. Refer the [Discord.js Docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/14.7.1/). You can always refer from there and return statisfied.
2. Try searching your query on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or [google](https://google.com)
3. You can head over to the official [Discord.js Server](https://discord.gg/djs) to get help from!
4. After all of this, if you still have questions in your mind, you can Direct Message [me](https://discordapp.com/users/919568881939517460) over discord.

# #Usage (with FAQs)
## How i use the code you've provided? Do i just copy paste them?🤔
Most of times copy paste might just work, but you wont learn something from it, it's also better if just analyze the code and do the needful

## Do i need any special command handler to run these codes?🤔
No, although you might need to install certain packages in order for the codes to run.
You will need to install following packages in your terminal:
* [Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)
* [Discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js)
* [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) 
> Note: Any other required package will be listed at the end of my code, make sure you have the right packages installed before running the code!
